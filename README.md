Project Title: **House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning in Python**
 
**Project Overview**
This project predicts the selling price of a house based on its features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other attributes. Using machine learning regression models, the goal is to provide an accurate price estimate that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in decision-making.

**Dataset**
Source: 2,620 listings from the Chennai zone (Makaan → via Kaggle)

**Features**
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Area (sq. ft.)
- Stories
- Parking availability
- Air conditioning
- And more...
**Target**: House selling price

**Tools & Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for development
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, etc.

**Methodology**
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding relationships between features and price.
- Model Training – Testing multiple regression models.
- Evaluation – Comparing model performance using metrics like R² and RMSE.
- Prediction – Predicting prices for new input data.

**Results**
- Best performing model: Linear Regression (or whichever you used finally)
- Achieved good accuracy in predicting house prices from given attributes.

**Project Impact**
- Can help real estate agents and buyers estimate fair property prices.
- Can be integrated into real estate apps and websites for instant predictions.

**My Role & Contribution**
- Cleaned and prepared dataset
- Performed EDA and visualizations
- Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models
- Evaluated and selected the best-performing model

**Future Work**
- Deploy as an Interactive Web App: Build a user-friendly interface (e.g., using Streamlit or FastAPI) where users can enter property details and get instant price predictions.
- Enhance Model Accuracy with More Features: Add property location coordinates, nearby amenities, and construction year to improve predictions.
